            <h2> History </h2>
            <p>Initially, BMW started as a struggling airplane engine company, eventually transitioning into one of the most well-known luxury car manufacturers in the world. Throughout its history, BMW has survived wars that brought other manufacturers to their knees. The luxury automobile manufacturer was on a mission to prove that they were the epitome of excellent German engineering. With determination, BMW grew from a single small production facility near Munich into a global empire with over thirty facilities stationed all over the world. Proving that they were more than just a car manufacturer, BMW has become a primary sponsor in the world of professional golfing and has tackled major social issues. Learn the history of BMW, from rags to riches.</p>

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Karl Friedrich Rapp founded his company Rapp-Motorenwerke in October of 1913. With tensions running high throughout Europe, it was only a matter of time before WW1 would begin. As a result, Rapp sold aircraft engines to meet the high demand at the time. Despite the great need for his services, Rapp’s aircraft engines had an inherent flaw that caused the engine to experience unwanted vibrations and his business began to struggle. His competition, Gustav Otto, owner of an aircraft engine plant, was able to flourish during this time.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapp_Motorenwerke">Rapp-Motorwerke</a>  was able to hang on by a thread for several years until 1916. Karl Rapp was nearly forced to give way to the financial burdens that pressed down upon his company during that harrowing period. Thankfully, the Prussian army ordered 600 airplane engines from Rapp-Motorwerke, giving Rapp the boost he needed to save his business from going under. He eventually formed a partnership with business owner Fran-Josef Popp and his financing partner Camillo Castiglioni, giving birth to the <a href="https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/Bayerische_Flugzeugwerke_AG">Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke</a>  BFW.  It wasn’t long before BFW transitioned into BMW.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>In 1917, the first BMW logo was created. It included blue and white, a reflection of the Bavarian state colors. Over the years, the logo underwent several changes, but it still stayed true to its roots – maintaining its original blue and white colors.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>In 1923, BMW began its first metamorphosis when it expanded from manufacturing airplane engines to motorcycles. This change was a big step for the company. Before the transition, BMW had only produced engines as a standalone part. Now, they were manufacturing an entire vehicle. They announced that their first motorcycle would be called the R32. The design was considered to be so efficient that the original 1923 concept is still used to this day in modern day BMW motorcycles.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>After their purchase of Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, the third largest automobile manufacturer located in Germany at the time, BMW began working on their first car. Instead of producing vehicles at their plant in Munich, BMW decided to use the former Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach plant in Central Germany. BMW found the inspiration for their first manufactured automobile from a borrowed design from the Austin Motor Company. BMW would rely on such methods until 1932, where they used their own models to build a vehicle unique to their brand.</p>

          <h2>Post War</h2>
          <p>In 1951, BMW proved to be a survivor and bounced back by producing its first automobile since the outbreak of the war. This vehicle was dubbed the 501 and was known for its large interior that could sit six people comfortably. The 501 was originally marketed as a luxury vehicle, though it ultimately failed. Despite its failure, the 501 allowed BMW to get back on track and reestablished the company's reputation as a top of the line vehicle manufacturer. Not only was BMW known for its high-quality manufacturing standards, but it was also known for incorporating the latest technology into its vehicle lines. The 501 lasted until 1958 when BMW decided to pull it from the production lines.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>In 1959 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimler_AG"> Daimler-Benz</a>attempted to acquire BMW. The BMW shareholders decided to reject the offer at the end of the year. With the cash assistance from the rebounding German government, BMW was able to restructure with a new manager at the helm. It had taken the company 15 years to get to where they were presently, and they weren’t going down without a fight.</p>

          <h2>A New Millennium</h2>
          <p>Having survived two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">world wars</a> , BMW has proven that it is an active, vital organization with the will to survive. Entering a new century, BMW began to concentrate on growing and changing once more. The company put the last holdover from the Rover Group, The Mini, to work by building a plant that specialized in manufacturing the vehicle. Over time, the Mini became highly popular throughout the world. It became so popular in fact, that production had to increase by 150% to meet demand.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>BMW further expanded its global empire by opening up three new manufacturing plants. A message was being sent, and it was loud and clear: BMW wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon. A <a href="https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en_GB/home.html">Rolls-Royce</a>  plant opened its doors in Goodwood in 2003. Soon after, a new facility came to life in Shenyang, China. Finally, the last plant was opened right in Leipzig, Germany. The newest German plant was viewed as an architectural marvel and won the German Architecture Award of the year sometime after its opening.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Today, BMW continues to look towards the future with growth, technology, and profitability as its main focuses. The ambitious automobile group has claimed that by 2020, they plan to be the <a href="https://www.autosofdallas.com/blog/what-are-the-top-luxury-car-brands-and-their-parent-companies/">leading luxury automotive manufacturer</a>  in the industry. Car owners of such an ambitious automobile group must choose bmw cover to protect against scratches, dust, environmental damage, UV rays, and other hazards that can cause premature wear. From BMW's inception, BMW has faced a hard road. They have persevered through some of the toughest periods of human history. BMW never faltered and continued to strive to improve their business. The 21st century introduced a stronger, faster, and leaner organization than ever before and has propelled BMW to new heights as one of the leading luxury automotive brands in the world.</p>
